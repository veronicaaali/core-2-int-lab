            <span class="detail"
              >After reading this article, I was amused and struck by several of
              the author&#39;s points. The author mentions that the content she
              was exposed to at work was very different from what was available
              on the web in the mid &#39;90s and that she came late enough to
              enjoy and benefit from the &#34;benefits of civilization&#34;.
              What the author means is that there was a lot of content that
              existed before the Internet was accessible, that later generations
              could add to or develop from that base, and that there was a
              network of connections between these things. The author mentions
              &#34;a lot of imitation and collection, and they use the earlier
              elements and styles as counter-examples.&#34; But in my opinion, I
              think it depends on how they are used, and I don&#39;t think we
              should start pursuing them just to achieve a certain goal or
              because everyone is using them. “Just as clothing styles come back
              into fashion so do web designs.” I couldn&#39;t agree more,
              it&#39;s as if elements of Y2K are suddenly popular again in 2022,
              and as the web continues to evolve and change in the social flood;
              there will always be new elements, graphics, and designs, so I
              think it&#39;s important to find what works for you and your
              project. Question: Will design elements that were popular years or
              even decades ago be brought back into the public eye in future
              designs? If so, what design elements are representative?</span

            <span class="detail"
              >&#34;What is a website?&#34; A website can be interpreted in
              different ways, from a file or a package of files located on a
              server somewhere, to a website in the world, I think a website is
              a vague and undefinable thing because behind it there are infinite
              possibilities and it brings different meanings and impacts. As the
              author says, &#34;My favorite aspect of websites is their duality:
              they&#39;re both subject and object at once. When one devotes
              energy to a website, that website in turn helps form one&#39;s own
              unique identity. I really appreciate the author&#39;s perspective
              on why websites are necessary, and she mentions the unique example
              of the artist, who is good at creating the world and also has the
              ability to show the world where the web is going. Artists and the
              Internet both intermingle in a virtuous, self-improving cycle, and
              I think this is a great point to ponder. I really like several of
              the author&#39;s metaphorical objects, rooms, shelves, factories,
              gardens, puddles, and rocks, and her analogy of these worldly
              objects to the web cleverly explains the interconnectedness of
              these objects and websites. If a website has infinite
              possibilities, and our identities, ideas, and dreams are created
              and expanded by them, then it helps that websites progress with
              us, and in an age of information overload, artists can think more
              broadly about what a website can be. Question: Now that we know
              what a website is and the meaning and impact behind it, how should
              a good website be defined?</span

            <span class="detail"
              >The article discusses the design and architecture of the Web and
              how its underlying structure affects the user experience. Most of
              the curing techniques we practice come from the natural ways of
              the web, ways that have existed from the beginning, but every step
              away from their intent weakens the outcome of the creation. I
              completely agree with Chimero that the design of the web is shaped
              by its texture, or the direction and patterns in which it is
              built, and that this texture influences the way users interact
              with and understand the site. Designers must create websites with
              texture in mind, and need to create an experience that is not only
              intuitive and easy to use, but also aesthetically pleasing to the
              audience. This idea of embracing the &#34;texture&#34; of the
              medium is an important concept in design that applies not only to
              the web, but to all forms of communication and expression. Chimero
              also talked about the concept of progressive enhancement, an
              approach to design that prioritizes accessibility and user
              experience, even for those using older or less advanced
              technologies. This is a critical consideration for designers who
              want to create a web that is inclusive and accessible to all,
              regardless of their device or Internet connection. The web is
              constantly evolving and designers must be adaptable and flexible
              in their approach in order to create the best user experience
              possible.</span

              The article examines the historical impact that white men have had
              on shaping the technology industry and the values it represents.
              It posits that the shift towards entrepreneurship in the 1940s and
              1950s marked a departure from the traditional academic model and
              instead focused on utilizing technology for practical purposes.
              Additionally, the author delves into the issue of race and its
              significance in the technology sector. They maintain that
              whiteness is a central aspect of Silicon Valley&#39;s laboratory
              culture and that the industry perpetuates anti-blackness through
              its products and procedures. The transition from a black to a
              white computer interface screen is employed as a metaphor to
              symbolize the robbery and removal of blackness and the
              establishment of a white, universal ideological structure. This
              article became a significant discovery for me regarding hidden
              aspects of technological development and its strong relations to
              current pressing topics. I was struck by the author&#39;s argument
              that the transition from black to white screen is a metaphor for
              the theft and erasure of blackness, highlighting the
              anti-blackness within the technology industry. It is impressive
              how various aspects of human life were impacted by this factor,
              penetrating deep into its very foundation. The article made me
              reflect on the importance of being aware of these usually
              overlooked issues and critically examining technology&#39;s impact
              on society. It is also paramount to acknowledge how race and power
              dynamics have influenced the development of technology and
              humanity as a whole. This text serves as a personal reminder of
              the necessity of embracing diversity and inclusiveness in the
              technology sector. It underscores the detrimental effects of
              having an industry controlled by a single group and the
              corresponding lack of understanding and consideration for the
              experiences and necessities of other communities. Recognizing the
              history and values that have shaped the development of technology
              is crucial for the creation of a more equitable and accommodating
              industry in the future. A new perspective gave me a unique
              opportunity to examine the topic from an entirely unexplored
              perspective to find new insights for me. It is excellent that
              today humanity is moving towards a more equal and fair society,
              revealing previously hidden aspects of our development. This topic
              is highly relevant nowadays and definitely needs further
              exploration.</span

            <br />
            <span class="detail"
              >The article discusses how &#34;function&#34; in the context of
              product design is not just about human needs projected onto
              objects but is also a narrative. The author believes that all
              man-made objects have a &#34;magical circle&#34; that surrounds
              them and creates a potential story through their function. To
              explore this idea, the author creates products and objects, with
              the first series of works based on the notion of
              &#34;container&#34;. The author believes that if function tells
              stories, then form and material are words and phrases that people
              can read. The article also mentions the evolution of function and
              how the form no longer bears any relation to function. The article
              provides an interesting perspective on the role of FUNCTION in the
              design of objects and products. The author&#39;s examples of her
              works demonstrate how FUNCTION can lead to potential stories and
              how objects can narrate through their FUNCTION. The article also
              raises important questions about the relationship between form,
              material, and FUNCTION, suggesting that they are interconnected in
              the design of objects. The author&#39;s argument that man-made
              products indicate potential changes or tell pending stories
              challenges the assumption that design simply changes people&#39;s
              lives.</span

              >
              <br />
              <span class="detail"
                >The article examines and elucidates the challenges of preserving a large amount of information online. She argues that the Internet is on the brink of becoming an untraceable tangle of information. According to Lepore, one of the most significant challenges facing digital archivists, such as Kahle, a digital utopian struggling to counter a digital dystopia, is the constant evolution of the Internet. Websites, webpages, and hyperlinks are often changing and disappearing. Besides, the sheer size of the Internet makes it challenging to archive all digital information. Since traditional publishers are not responsible for producing much of the content, it implies that existing archiving systems may never capture it.
                Despite these challenges, there is a need to develop effective mechanisms for preserving digital information to help future generations understand the Internet's history and impact on society. Lepore highlights various responses to the problems associated with digital archiving. For instance, she cites how the Wayback Machine, pioneered by the Internet Archive in 1996, has successfully preserved over 430 billion Web pages. However, Lepore reiterates the importance of ensuring the quality and accuracy of archived digital content. She also expresses concerns about risks associated with using the stored information for surveillance and censorship. 
                Lepore's article offers insight into the importance of responding to digital archiving issues. Addressing such challenges requires critically analyzing the benefits and potential risks of maintaining digital information. Perhaps the world should consider developing ethical guidelines and standards to prioritize personal privacy and other contentious social issues, such as freedom of expression. More importantly, it is paramount to ensure that digital archives are easily accessible and solely utilized for the public good. Nonetheless, Lepore concurs that it is somewhat impossible to devise an easy solution. However, she is optimistic that the world will soon develop an effective archiving system.</span

              <span class="detail"
                >The article argues that data and technology are not neutral, and that they can perpetuate inequalities and reinforce existing power structures if they are not approached with a feminist perspective. The authors offer practical solutions and strategies for creating more equitable and just data practices, including the need for diversity in data teams, the importance of considering the social context in which data is collected and analyzed, and the need to challenge dominant narratives and assumptions about who data is for and what it can do. Besides, the article highlights the importance of acknowledging the role that values, assumptions, and biases play in data collection, analysis, and interpretation. The authors' proposed framework for practicing data feminism is a necessary step towards creating more equitable and just outcomes in various fields, including education, healthcare, and criminal justice. I appreciate the authors' emphasis on challenging power dynamics and considering the context of data. It is essential to recognize that data is not neutral and can be used to reinforce existing power structures and biases. By questioning these structures and contexts, we can work towards creating more inclusive and diverse datasets that better reflect the populations they represent. Embracing pluralism in both data and interpretation is critical. By recognizing and valuing different perspectives and experiences, we can create more comprehensive and nuanced analyses that better capture the complexity of the world around us.
