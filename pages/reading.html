              >After reading this article, I was amused and struck by several of
              the author&#39;s points. The author mentions that the content she
              was exposed to at work was very different from what was available
              on the web in the mid &#39;90s and that she came late enough to
              enjoy and benefit from the &#34;benefits of civilization&#34;.
              What the author means is that there was a lot of content that
              existed before the Internet was accessible, that later generations
              could add to or develop from that base, and that there was a
              network of connections between these things. The author mentions
              &#34;a lot of imitation and collection, and they use the earlier
              elements and styles as counter-examples.&#34; But in my opinion, I
              think it depends on how they are used, and I don&#39;t think we
              should start pursuing them just to achieve a certain goal or
              because everyone is using them. “Just as clothing styles come back
              into fashion so do web designs.” I couldn&#39;t agree more,
              it&#39;s as if elements of Y2K are suddenly popular again in 2022,
              and as the web continues to evolve and change in the social flood;
              there will always be new elements, graphics, and designs, so I
              think it&#39;s important to find what works for you and your
              project. Question: Will design elements that were popular years or
              even decades ago be brought back into the public eye in future
              designs? If so, what design elements are representative?</span

              knowledge. What could yours be? by Laurel Schwulst</span

            <span class="detail"
              >&#34;What is a website?&#34; A website can be interpreted in
              different ways, from a file or a package of files located on a
              server somewhere, to a website in the world, I think a website is
              a vague and undefinable thing because behind it there are infinite
              possibilities and it brings different meanings and impacts. As the
              author says, &#34;My favorite aspect of websites is their duality:
              they&#39;re both subject and object at once. When one devotes
              energy to a website, that website in turn helps form one&#39;s own
              unique identity. I really appreciate the author&#39;s perspective
              on why websites are necessary, and she mentions the unique example
              of the artist, who is good at creating the world and also has the
              ability to show the world where the web is going. Artists and the
              Internet both intermingle in a virtuous, self-improving cycle, and
              I think this is a great point to ponder. I really like several of
              the author&#39;s metaphorical objects, rooms, shelves, factories,
              gardens, puddles, and rocks, and her analogy of these worldly
              objects to the web cleverly explains the interconnectedness of
              these objects and websites. If a website has infinite
              possibilities, and our identities, ideas, and dreams are created
              and expanded by them, then it helps that websites progress with
              us, and in an age of information overload, artists can think more
              broadly about what a website can be. Question: Now that we know
              what a website is and the meaning and impact behind it, how should
              a good website be defined?</span

            <span class="detail"
              >The article discusses the design and architecture of the Web and
              how its underlying structure affects the user experience. Most of
              the curing techniques we practice come from the natural ways of
              the web, ways that have existed from the beginning, but every step
              away from their intent weakens the outcome of the creation. I
              completely agree with Chimero that the design of the web is shaped
              by its texture, or the direction and patterns in which it is
              built, and that this texture influences the way users interact
              with and understand the site. Designers must create websites with
              texture in mind, and need to create an experience that is not only
              intuitive and easy to use, but also aesthetically pleasing to the
              audience. This idea of embracing the &#34;texture&#34; of the
              medium is an important concept in design that applies not only to
              the web, but to all forms of communication and expression. Chimero
              also talked about the concept of progressive enhancement, an
              approach to design that prioritizes accessibility and user
              experience, even for those using older or less advanced
              technologies. This is a critical consideration for designers who
              want to create a web that is inclusive and accessible to all,
              regardless of their device or Internet connection. The web is
              constantly evolving and designers must be adaptable and flexible
              in their approach in order to create the best user experience
              possible.</span
