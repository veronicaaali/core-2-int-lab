              >The world of design is explorable and interactive, allowing
              designers and design students to expand their creativity. Design
              education factors in different aspects of individuality and
              uniqueness. However, the majority has dominated this field,
              excluding many people of color from the industry. According to the
              lecture, the design industry lacks diversity and inclusion.
              Although many students acknowledge cultural diversity and
              decolonization, students from the minority population are yet to
              embrace design education. The notions of inclusion in the
              contemporary world have gradually shifted as many people, and
              resistance groups advocate for equality and diversity.
              Nevertheless, a significant percentage of individuals around the
              globe still dismiss inclusion and openness in social institutions.
              As such, many organizations and companies have not embraced fair
              treatment to all people regardless of race, gender, and status.
              The design industry falls under racial segregation since designers
              play a pivotal role in the costumes and fashion industry. The
              professionals create long-term experiences and a positive impact
              on community members. Correspondingly, designers spend their time
              creating and exploring various events, enhancing their connections
              with different groups of people in society. However, many people
              of color in the design education and industry today choose this
              profession to make a change. The high incidence of inequality and
              racial discrimination have encouraged designers to create an
              opportunity to influence paradigm shifts in design and promote
              inclusion. The lecture provides insight into decolonization in the
              design industry. Although the notion invokes a change of narrative
              in different spectrums across the globe, it is not a metaphor for
              the change required by designers in the design industry. Many
              design students in minority populations need help creating designs
              connected to their culture and identity since they must study
              their histories outside school. For this reason, decolonization
              does not fit in the design industry regardless of its capacity to
              include certain factors about culture and indigenous lands. Hence,
              the design industry has a long way to go in understanding
              diversity. Many designers only have experience in particular
              design aspects, such as Eurocentric design standards. This form of
              design provides specific interphases for projects limited to a few
              languages. Designers need assistance in promoting change in this
              industry due to the status quo of design standards. Diversity
              transcends beyond race since gender-based inequality has taken a
              toll on the design industry. Many men have dominated the sector,
              and only an insignificant proportion of women hold influential
              leadership positions. In addition, female designers earn lower
              salaries compared to their male counterparts. For this reason,
              design students of color are skeptical about pursuing design as a
              profession following the constraints and challenges in this
              industry. Technology has transformed the design industry through
              innovation, improving many lives in modern society. The concepts
              have triggered shifts in people&#39;s lifestyles since they can
              infiltrate each product, solution, and moment in their everyday
              activities. However, the design industry needs to make changes in
              diversity and inclusivity to elevate the success margin of the
              industry. Designers should individually use this platform to share
              their cultures and tell stories about their backgrounds and
              traditions. On the same note, organizations and design companies
              should appreciate and integrate alternative ideas and embrace
              diverse cultural perspectives to influence creativity and
              innovation. Diversity and inclusion in the design industry will
              foster growth and promote a safe space for people to explore their
              imagination.</span
