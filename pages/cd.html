              >The world of design is explorable and interactive, allowing
              designers and design students to expand their creativity. Design
              education factors in different aspects of individuality and
              uniqueness. However, the majority has dominated this field,
              excluding many people of color from the industry. According to the
              lecture, the design industry lacks diversity and inclusion.
              Although many students acknowledge cultural diversity and
              decolonization, students from the minority population are yet to
              embrace design education. The notions of inclusion in the
              contemporary world have gradually shifted as many people, and
              resistance groups advocate for equality and diversity.
              Nevertheless, a significant percentage of individuals around the
              globe still dismiss inclusion and openness in social institutions.
              As such, many organizations and companies have not embraced fair
              treatment to all people regardless of race, gender, and status.
              The design industry falls under racial segregation since designers
              play a pivotal role in the costumes and fashion industry. The
              professionals create long-term experiences and a positive impact
              on community members. Correspondingly, designers spend their time
              creating and exploring various events, enhancing their connections
              with different groups of people in society. However, many people
              of color in the design education and industry today choose this
              profession to make a change. The high incidence of inequality and
              racial discrimination have encouraged designers to create an
              opportunity to influence paradigm shifts in design and promote
              inclusion. The lecture provides insight into decolonization in the
              design industry. Although the notion invokes a change of narrative
              in different spectrums across the globe, it is not a metaphor for
              the change required by designers in the design industry. Many
              design students in minority populations need help creating designs
              connected to their culture and identity since they must study
              their histories outside school. For this reason, decolonization
              does not fit in the design industry regardless of its capacity to
              include certain factors about culture and indigenous lands. Hence,
              the design industry has a long way to go in understanding
              diversity. Many designers only have experience in particular
              design aspects, such as Eurocentric design standards. This form of
              design provides specific interphases for projects limited to a few
              languages. Designers need assistance in promoting change in this
              industry due to the status quo of design standards. Diversity
              transcends beyond race since gender-based inequality has taken a
              toll on the design industry. Many men have dominated the sector,
              and only an insignificant proportion of women hold influential
              leadership positions. In addition, female designers earn lower
              salaries compared to their male counterparts. For this reason,
              design students of color are skeptical about pursuing design as a
              profession following the constraints and challenges in this
              industry. Technology has transformed the design industry through
              innovation, improving many lives in modern society. The concepts
              have triggered shifts in people&#39;s lifestyles since they can
              infiltrate each product, solution, and moment in their everyday
              activities. However, the design industry needs to make changes in
              diversity and inclusivity to elevate the success margin of the
              industry. Designers should individually use this platform to share
              their cultures and tell stories about their backgrounds and
              traditions. On the same note, organizations and design companies
              should appreciate and integrate alternative ideas and embrace
              diverse cultural perspectives to influence creativity and
              innovation. Diversity and inclusion in the design industry will
              foster growth and promote a safe space for people to explore their
              imagination.</span

            <br />
            <span class="detail"
              >The presenter discusses the evolution of graphical user
              interfaces starting from the first design in 1963 created by Ivan
              Sutherland to the desktop metaphor introduced by Xerox Alto to
              Microsoft Windows and Apple Lisa. She explains how these
              interfaces were designed to make it easier for people to interact
              with computers using metaphors that people can relate to from the
              physical world. The Apple Lisa and the Xerox Alto, which were
              among the first systems to incorporate the concept of a desktop
              metaphor. The presenter also talks about the importance of user
              interface design in creating more intuitive and efficient
              interactions with computers. The presenter also explores the
              limitations of traditional user interfaces, such as fixed buttons
              and keyboards that cannot change based on the application&#39;s
              requirements. The lecture also highlights the significance of GUIs
              in making computing accessible to a broader audience and
              facilitating collaborative work. It offers a glimpse into the
              history of personal computing and how GUIs have shaped our
              interactions with technology. The presenter also touches on the
              challenges and limitations, particularly the need for
              revolutionary user interfaces that can adapt to the changing needs
              of users. Question: What are some of the current trends in design,
              and how are they shaping the future of computing?</span

            <span class="title">02/16/2023 Lecture: Lynn Kiang</span>
            <br />
            <span class="detail"
              >Kiang provides insight into a technology based career. I was
              impressed to see two minority women at the helm of an impactful
              business, setting a good example and providing opportunities for
              other minorities. Kiang and Lee use their platform to advocate for
              the representation of women in leadership and for equal treatment
              of women in social and economic settings. Their work also promotes
              cultural aspects, such as art and music. I applaud Kiang for
              teaching as a way of giving back to the community. I am encouraged
              that Kiang acknowledges that she benefitted from the education
              system and that other students deserve good quality education
              delivered by experienced and passionate people. One of my
              take-home messages from the lecture is the value of collaboration
              in the design process. For example, Dome is the product of a
              collaboration between Kiang and Lee. I also learned about the
              value of incorporating clients and end users in decision-making.
              The women empowerment project exemplifies how technology can be
              used to create solutions to people’s problems and social issues. I
              also learned that designs should communicate clearly to their
              intended audience and spark conversations. From Kiang’s experience
              and advice, this field of study and work requires continuous
              learning. Education provides the basics and work helps one apply
              knowledge in real-life situations. I particularly liked Kiang’s
              advice to “steal everything” from the workplace. I agree that
              every job, whether or not it aligns with one’s intended career, is
              an opportunity to acquire knowledge, skills, and connections. I
              also believe that being intentional in any job helps one to build
              their work ethic, which is helpful in future employment or
              self-employment.</span

            <br />
            <span class="detail"
              >Throughout the evolutionary process, the sociopolitical discourses perform a role of an effective approach to reveal the truth occurring during the procedures of leveling subjectivity. However, humans tend to modify the methods and principles of using different visual narratives. The features of design practices change under the impact of ethnic and cultural factors. The Phaistos Project, developed by Pascal Glissmann, contains encrypted information in forty -five unique symbols turning into a universal form of visual narratives showing the outcomes of the sociopolitical discourses.
            </p>
              The Phaistos Disc, discovered in 1908, inspired Pascal Glissmann to create the forty-five symbols developed to reflect current concerns, including economic, ecological, social, and political challenges. The ethnographic visual narratives turned into a prototype for introducing a modern symbol set. Glissmann used computational processes based on an analysis of Big Data as a foundation for developing visual algorithms to demonstrate unseen societal patterns. The Phaistos Project became a prerequisite for an in-depth analysis of people’s everyday environment and circumstances affecting their quality of life. The forty-five symbols represent a symbiosis of past historical decisions and intentions to improve living conditions. The project results allow the individuals to capture current social and political events through an innovative symbol system based on the accumulated experience of previous generations.
            </p> 
              The area of technology innovation improves by increasing the volume of Big Data operations. The disappearance of information recorded on electronic media will lead to a cultural collapse caused by destroying valuable historical facts. The Phaistos Project implies stimulating the impulse to use the forty-five symbols as a simple and inviolable way to reflect the outcomes of the sociopolitical discourses to capture evolutionary processes objectively. This idea shows a high potential to create a perfect system of symbols to save Big Data without involving innovative devices and their vulnerability to harmful external influences. </span

            <br />
            <span class="detail"
              >E. Roon Kang and Andrew Leclair delivered the class which details their research initiative – 908, focused on creating new design tools in partnership with cultural organizations and building on the work for clients such as Google and MIT Architecture. The 908a initiative develops the intellectual framework within the school community around design as the shaping of instructions. In highlighting the nature of the undertaking, the speakers focused on ‘110 100,’ a book that they designed for the communication design program at Parsons. The speakers detail that the tradition of creating printed catalogs every year commenced in 2013. The team opted for an annual publication for its longevity instead of making end-year exhibitions that tend to disappear once held. As opposed to the shows, books offer students an opportunity to showcase unique designs, which are now visible in different design studios around the city, on campus, and in companies. 
The 908a design team developed the publication to feature various elements of students’ thesis. The key elements include research topics, brief description of the theses, and images pertaining to the projects. Initially, the 908a had the challenge of compiling thousands of student submissions through Google Drive within a short window between early April and early May and ensuring they published the compiled publication in time for graduation in mid-May. To address the time constraint and ensure that they feature as many student entries in the book, the 908a team opted to develop a database in the form of a website that would allow students to populate the template with different aspects of their thesis. Using the Prince XML tool, the team could also convert the HTML text in the website to PDF, thereby having a ready document in a short duration. Upon settling on the approach for collecting students’ entries, the other aspects of the project include a consideration for additional content to include in the publication and the maximum number of pages of the document in line with the publishing budget. Hence, the 908a initiative focuses on providing students an opportunity to showcase their research in a permanent way for future reference. 
Additionally, the team would consider aesthetic elements of the book, such as print color and the type of paper on which they would print the work. Moreover, using a database for students to populate different aspects of their theses instead of submitting Google Drive files highlights the use cases for technology solutions to age-old design challenges. Overall, the 908a design project is an ingenious initiative for commemorating students’ achievements and the institution’s success as a center for research on account of the different theses featured in the publication.</span

            <span class="title">04/21/2023 Lecture: Kelly Walters</span>
            <br />
            <span class="detail"
              >E. Roon Kang and Kelly Waters delivered the lecture, detailing a presentation of some of Waters’ projects as an artist and emphasizing the evolution of design throughout history, more so from the late 19th century. One of the projects included in the presentation was at the Hamilton Wood Type and Printing Museum in Two Rivers, Wisconsin, dedicated to preserving, researching, producing, and printing wood types used in letterpress typing. During her artist residency at the museum, Waters worked with The Inquirer collection comprising early-20th century woodblocks that were advertisements for theater, stage performances, vaudeville performances, and circus. In her other project – With a Case of Colored Stars, in New York – Waters worked on the visual representation of African-American cinema and music. Specifically, the project sought to depict the evolution of racialized iconography within Black American popular entertainment. Her final project – The Black Experience in Design – was a publication focused on the experiences of African-Americans in design and was inspired by the socio-political unrest experienced at the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, owing to police brutality and the ensuing Black Lives Matter movement. As such, Waters highlights the usefulness of art in expressing socio-cultural issues, particularly the dynamics of racial discrimination.
              </p> 
              The lecture provided a unique perspective on the blend of artistic design and socio-cultural issues. Through her projects, Waters details how racialized tendencies are historically situated in art and what their evolution over the years looks like. In her project at the Hamilton Wood Type and Printing Museum, Waters’ artistic presentation showcased the oversexualized depiction of women. It is intriguing that even in the late 19th century, the designs used in marketing events relied on women in risqué apparel to capture the interest of potential patrons to the events. Additionally, non-white women,  were not featured in the art, which is interesting considering that the depiction of women was degrading. Another aspect that emerged from the Waters’ projects is that unique design features were used to depict African-Americans and shape the conceptions of Blackness in the United States. It is intriguing how Black performing artists were not immune to discrimination despite their contribution to the American art scene in the 20th century. The irony was that the same art African-American artists used to champion causes for people of color was used to propagate discrimination against them.
