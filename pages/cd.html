              >The world of design is explorable and interactive, allowing
              designers and design students to expand their creativity. Design
              education factors in different aspects of individuality and
              uniqueness. However, the majority has dominated this field,
              excluding many people of color from the industry. According to the
              lecture, the design industry lacks diversity and inclusion.
              Although many students acknowledge cultural diversity and
              decolonization, students from the minority population are yet to
              embrace design education. The notions of inclusion in the
              contemporary world have gradually shifted as many people, and
              resistance groups advocate for equality and diversity.
              Nevertheless, a significant percentage of individuals around the
              globe still dismiss inclusion and openness in social institutions.
              As such, many organizations and companies have not embraced fair
              treatment to all people regardless of race, gender, and status.
              The design industry falls under racial segregation since designers
              play a pivotal role in the costumes and fashion industry. The
              professionals create long-term experiences and a positive impact
              on community members. Correspondingly, designers spend their time
              creating and exploring various events, enhancing their connections
              with different groups of people in society. However, many people
              of color in the design education and industry today choose this
              profession to make a change. The high incidence of inequality and
              racial discrimination have encouraged designers to create an
              opportunity to influence paradigm shifts in design and promote
              inclusion. The lecture provides insight into decolonization in the
              design industry. Although the notion invokes a change of narrative
              in different spectrums across the globe, it is not a metaphor for
              the change required by designers in the design industry. Many
              design students in minority populations need help creating designs
              connected to their culture and identity since they must study
              their histories outside school. For this reason, decolonization
              does not fit in the design industry regardless of its capacity to
              include certain factors about culture and indigenous lands. Hence,
              the design industry has a long way to go in understanding
              diversity. Many designers only have experience in particular
              design aspects, such as Eurocentric design standards. This form of
              design provides specific interphases for projects limited to a few
              languages. Designers need assistance in promoting change in this
              industry due to the status quo of design standards. Diversity
              transcends beyond race since gender-based inequality has taken a
              toll on the design industry. Many men have dominated the sector,
              and only an insignificant proportion of women hold influential
              leadership positions. In addition, female designers earn lower
              salaries compared to their male counterparts. For this reason,
              design students of color are skeptical about pursuing design as a
              profession following the constraints and challenges in this
              industry. Technology has transformed the design industry through
              innovation, improving many lives in modern society. The concepts
              have triggered shifts in people&#39;s lifestyles since they can
              infiltrate each product, solution, and moment in their everyday
              activities. However, the design industry needs to make changes in
              diversity and inclusivity to elevate the success margin of the
              industry. Designers should individually use this platform to share
              their cultures and tell stories about their backgrounds and
              traditions. On the same note, organizations and design companies
              should appreciate and integrate alternative ideas and embrace
              diverse cultural perspectives to influence creativity and
              innovation. Diversity and inclusion in the design industry will
              foster growth and promote a safe space for people to explore their
              imagination.</span

            <span class="detail"
              >The presenter discusses the evolution of graphical user
              interfaces starting from the first design in 1963 created by Ivan
              Sutherland to the desktop metaphor introduced by Xerox Alto to
              Microsoft Windows and Apple Lisa. She explains how these
              interfaces were designed to make it easier for people to interact
              with computers using metaphors that people can relate to from the
              physical world. The Apple Lisa and the Xerox Alto, which were
              among the first systems to incorporate the concept of a desktop
              metaphor. The presenter also talks about the importance of user
              interface design in creating more intuitive and efficient
              interactions with computers. The presenter also explores the
              limitations of traditional user interfaces, such as fixed buttons
              and keyboards that cannot change based on the application&#39;s
              requirements. The lecture also highlights the significance of GUIs
              in making computing accessible to a broader audience and
              facilitating collaborative work. It offers a glimpse into the
              history of personal computing and how GUIs have shaped our
              interactions with technology. The presenter also touches on the
              challenges and limitations, particularly the need for
              revolutionary user interfaces that can adapt to the changing needs
              of users. Question: What are some of the current trends in design,
              and how are they shaping the future of computing?</span

            <span class="title">02/16/2023 Lecture: Lynn Kiang</span>
            <br />
            <span class="detail"
              >Kiang provides insight into a technology based career. I was
              impressed to see two minority women at the helm of an impactful
              business, setting a good example and providing opportunities for
              other minorities. Kiang and Lee use their platform to advocate for
              the representation of women in leadership and for equal treatment
              of women in social and economic settings. Their work also promotes
              cultural aspects, such as art and music. I applaud Kiang for
              teaching as a way of giving back to the community. I am encouraged
              that Kiang acknowledges that she benefitted from the education
              system and that other students deserve good quality education
              delivered by experienced and passionate people. One of my
              take-home messages from the lecture is the value of collaboration
              in the design process. For example, Dome is the product of a
              collaboration between Kiang and Lee. I also learned about the
              value of incorporating clients and end users in decision-making.
              The women empowerment project exemplifies how technology can be
              used to create solutions to people’s problems and social issues. I
              also learned that designs should communicate clearly to their
              intended audience and spark conversations. From Kiang’s experience
              and advice, this field of study and work requires continuous
              learning. Education provides the basics and work helps one apply
              knowledge in real-life situations. I particularly liked Kiang’s
              advice to “steal everything” from the workplace. I agree that
              every job, whether or not it aligns with one’s intended career, is
              an opportunity to acquire knowledge, skills, and connections. I
              also believe that being intentional in any job helps one to build
              their work ethic, which is helpful in future employment or
              self-employment.</span

            <br />
            <span class="detail"
              >Throughout the evolutionary process, the sociopolitical discourses perform a role of an effective approach to reveal the truth occurring during the procedures of leveling subjectivity. However, humans tend to modify the methods and principles of using different visual narratives. The features of design practices change under the impact of ethnic and cultural factors. The Phaistos Project, developed by Pascal Glissmann, contains encrypted information in forty -five unique symbols turning into a universal form of visual narratives showing the outcomes of the sociopolitical discourses.
            </p>
              The Phaistos Disc, discovered in 1908, inspired Pascal Glissmann to create the forty-five symbols developed to reflect current concerns, including economic, ecological, social, and political challenges. The ethnographic visual narratives turned into a prototype for introducing a modern symbol set. Glissmann used computational processes based on an analysis of Big Data as a foundation for developing visual algorithms to demonstrate unseen societal patterns. The Phaistos Project became a prerequisite for an in-depth analysis of people’s everyday environment and circumstances affecting their quality of life. The forty-five symbols represent a symbiosis of past historical decisions and intentions to improve living conditions. The project results allow the individuals to capture current social and political events through an innovative symbol system based on the accumulated experience of previous generations.
            </p> 
              The area of technology innovation improves by increasing the volume of Big Data operations. The disappearance of information recorded on electronic media will lead to a cultural collapse caused by destroying valuable historical facts. The Phaistos Project implies stimulating the impulse to use the forty-five symbols as a simple and inviolable way to reflect the outcomes of the sociopolitical discourses to capture evolutionary processes objectively. This idea shows a high potential to create a perfect system of symbols to save Big Data without involving innovative devices and their vulnerability to harmful external influences. </span
