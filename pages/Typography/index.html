      <h1>Anthropology</h1>
      <p><em>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</em></p>
      <p>
        Anthropology is the scientific study of humanity, concerned with human
        behavior, human biology, cultures, societies, and linguistics, in both
        the present and past, including past human species.<sup>[1][2][3]</sup>
        Social anthropology studies patterns of behavior, while cultural
        anthropology studies cultural meaning, including norms and values.<sup
          >[1][2][3]</sup
        >
        A portmanteau term sociocultural anthropology is commonly used
        today.<sup>[4]</sup> Linguistic anthropology studies how language
        influences social life. Biological or physical anthropology studies the
        biological development of humans.<sup>[1][2][3]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Archaeological anthropology, often termed as "anthropology of the past,"
        studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence.<sup
          >[5][6]</sup
        >
        It is considered a branch of anthropology in North America and Asia,
        while in Europe archaeology is viewed as a discipline in its own right
        or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history and
        palaeontology.<sup>[7]</sup>
      </p>

      <h2>Etymology</h2>
      <p>
        The abstract noun anthropology is first attested in reference to
        history.<sup>[8][n 1]</sup> Its present use first appeared in
        Renaissance Germany in the works of Magnus Hundt and Otto Casmann.<sup
          >[9]</sup
        >
        Their New Latin anthropologia derived from the combining forms of the
        Greek words <em>ánthrōpos</em>
        <span lang="gr">(ἄνθρωπος, "human")</span> and <em>lógos</em>
        <span lang="gr">(λόγος, "study")</span>.<sup>[8]</sup> Its adjectival
        form appeared in the works of Aristotle.<sup>[8]</sup> It began to be
        used in English, possibly via French Anthropologie, by the early 18th
        century.<sup>[8][n 2]</sup>
      </p>

      <h2>History</h2>
      <h3>Through the 19th century</h3>
      <p>
        In 1647, the Bartholins, early scholars of the University of Copenhagen,
        defined l'anthropologie as follows:<sup>[11]</sup>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        Anthropology, that is to say the science that treats of man, is divided
        ordinarily and with reason into Anatomy, which considers the body and
        the parts, and Psychology, which speaks of the soul.[n 3]
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Sporadic use of the term for some of the subject matter occurred
        subsequently, such as the use by Étienne Serres in 1839 to describe the
        natural history, or paleontology, of man, based on comparative anatomy,
        and the creation of a chair in anthropology and ethnography in 1850 at
        the French National Museum of Natural History by Jean Louis Armand de
        Quatrefages de Bréau. Various short-lived organizations of
        anthropologists had already been formed. The Société Ethnologique de
        Paris, the first to use the term ethnology, was formed in 1839. Its
        members were primarily anti-slavery activists. When slavery was
        abolished in France in 1848, the Société was abandoned.<sup
          >[citation needed]</sup
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, the Ethnological Society of New York, currently the American
        Ethnological Society, was founded on its model in 1842, as well as the
        Ethnological Society of London in 1843, a break-away group of the
        Aborigines' Protection Society.<sup>[12]</sup> These anthropologists of
        the times were liberal, anti-slavery, and pro-human-rights activists.
        They maintained international connections.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Anthropology and many other current fields are the intellectual results
        of the comparative methods developed in the earlier 19th century.
        Theorists in such diverse fields as anatomy, linguistics, and ethnology,
        making feature-by-feature comparisons of their subject matters, were
        beginning to suspect that similarities between animals, languages, and
        folkways were the result of processes or laws unknown to them then.<sup
          >[13]</sup
        >
        For them, the publication of Charles Darwin's On the Origin of Species
        was the epiphany of everything they had begun to suspect. Darwin himself
        arrived at his conclusions through comparison of species he had seen in
        agronomy and in the wild.
      </p>

      <p>
        Darwin and Wallace unveiled evolution in the late 1850s. There was an
        immediate rush to bring it into the social sciences. Paul Broca in Paris
        was in the process of breaking away from the Société de biologie to form
        the first of the explicitly anthropological societies, the Société
        d'Anthropologie de Paris, meeting for the first time in Paris in
        1859.<sup>[14][n 4]</sup> When he read Darwin, he became an immediate
        convert to Transformisme, as the French called evolutionism.<sup
          >[15]</sup
        >
        His definition now became "the study of the human group, considered as a
        whole, in its details, and in relation to the rest of nature".<sup
          >[16]</sup
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Broca, being what today would be called a neurosurgeon, had taken an
        interest in the pathology of speech. He wanted to localize the
        difference between man and the other animals, which appeared to reside
        in speech. He discovered the speech center of the human brain, today
        called Broca's area after him. His interest was mainly in Biological
        anthropology, but a German philosopher specializing in psychology,
        Theodor Waitz, took up the theme of general and social anthropology in
        his six-volume work, entitled Die Anthropologie der Naturvölker,
        1859–1864. The title was soon translated as "The Anthropology of
        Primitive Peoples". The last two volumes were published posthumously.
      </p>
      <p>
        Waitz defined anthropology as "the science of the nature of man".
        Following Broca's lead, Waitz points out that anthropology is a new
        field, which would gather material from other fields, but would differ
        from them in the use of comparative anatomy, physiology, and psychology
        to differentiate man from "the animals nearest to him". He stresses that
        the data of comparison must be empirical, gathered by
        experimentation.<sup>[17]</sup> The history of civilization, as well as
        ethnology, are to be brought into the comparison. It is to be presumed
        fundamentally that the species, man, is a unity, and that "the same laws
        of thought are applicable to all men".<sup>[18]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Waitz was influential among British ethnologists. In 1863, the explorer
        Richard Francis Burton and the speech therapist James Hunt broke away
        from the Ethnological Society of London to form the Anthropological
        Society of London, which henceforward would follow the path of the new
        anthropology rather than just ethnology. It was the 2nd society
        dedicated to general anthropology in existence. Representatives from the
        French Société were present, though not Broca. In his keynote address,
        printed in the first volume of its new publication, The Anthropological
        Review, Hunt stressed the work of Waitz, adopting his definitions as a
        standard.<sup>[19][n 5]</sup> Among the first associates were the young
        Edward Burnett Tylor, inventor of cultural anthropology, and his brother
        Alfred Tylor, a geologist. Previously Edward had referred to himself as
        an ethnologist; subsequently, an anthropologist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar organizations in other countries followed: The Anthropological
        Society of Madrid (1865), the American Anthropological Association in
        1902, the Anthropological Society of Vienna (1870), the Italian Society
        of Anthropology and Ethnology (1871), and many others subsequently. The
        majority of these were evolutionists. One notable exception was the
        Berlin Society for Anthropology, Ethnology, and Prehistory (1869)
        founded by Rudolph Virchow, known for his vituperative attacks on the
        evolutionists. Not religious himself, he insisted that Darwin's
        conclusions lacked empirical foundation.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the last three decades of the 19th century, a proliferation of
        anthropological societies and associations occurred, most independent,
        most publishing their own journals, and all international in membership
        and association. The major theorists belonged to these organizations.
        They supported the gradual osmosis of anthropology curricula into the
        major institutions of higher learning. By 1898, 48 educational
        institutions in 13 countries had some curriculum in anthropology. None
        of the 75 faculty members were under a department named
        anthropology.<sup>[20]</sup>
      </p>
      <h3>20th and 21st centuriesEdit</h3>
      <p>
        This meager statistic expanded in the 20th century to comprise
        anthropology departments in the majority of the world's higher
        educational institutions, many thousands in number. Anthropology has
        diversified from a few major subdivisions to dozens more. Practical
        anthropology, the use of anthropological knowledge and technique to
        solve specific problems, has arrived; for example, the presence of
        buried victims might stimulate the use of a forensic archaeologist to
        recreate the final scene. The organization has reached a global level.
        For example, the World Council of Anthropological Associations (WCAA),
        "a network of national, regional and international associations that
        aims to promote worldwide communication and cooperation in
        anthropology", currently contains members from about three dozen
        nations.<sup>[21]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the work of Franz Boas and Bronisław Malinowski in the late 19th
        and early 20th centuries, social anthropology in Great Britain and
        cultural anthropology in the US have been distinguished from other
        social sciences by their emphasis on cross-cultural comparisons,
        long-term in-depth examination of context, and the importance they place
        on participant-observation or experiential immersion in the area of
        research. Cultural anthropology, in particular, has emphasized cultural
        relativism, holism, and the use of findings to frame cultural
        critiques.<sup>[22]</sup> This has been particularly prominent in the
        United States, from Boas' arguments against 19th-century racial
        ideology, through Margaret Mead's advocacy for gender equality and
        sexual liberation, to current criticisms of post-colonial oppression and
        promotion of multiculturalism. Ethnography is one of its primary
        research designs as well as the text that is generated from
        anthropological fieldwork.<sup>[23][24][25]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        In Great Britain and the Commonwealth countries, the British tradition
        of social anthropology tends to dominate. In the United States,
        anthropology has traditionally been divided into the four field approach
        developed by Franz Boas in the early 20th century: biological or
        physical anthropology; social, cultural, or sociocultural anthropology;
        and archaeological anthropology; plus linguistic anthropology. These
        fields frequently overlap but tend to use different methodologies and
        techniques.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        European countries with overseas colonies tended to practice more
        ethnology (a term coined and defined by Adam F. Kollár in 1783). It is
        sometimes referred to as sociocultural anthropology in the parts of the
        world that were influenced by the European tradition.<sup>[26]</sup>

        Anthropology is a global discipline involving humanities, social
        sciences and natural sciences. Anthropology builds upon knowledge from
        natural sciences, including the discoveries about the origin and
        evolution of Homo sapiens, human physical traits, human behavior, the
        variations among different groups of humans, how the evolutionary past
        of Homo sapiens has influenced its social organization and culture, and
        from social sciences, including the organization of human social and
        cultural relations, institutions, social conflicts, etc.<sup
          >[27][28]</sup
        >
        Early anthropology originated in Classical Greece and Persia and studied
        and tried to understand observable cultural diversity, such as by
        Al-Biruni of the Islamic Golden Age.<sup>[29][30]</sup> As such,
        anthropology has been central in the development of several new (late
        20th century) interdisciplinary fields such as cognitive science,<sup
          >[31]</sup
        >
        global studies, and various ethnic studies.
      </p>
      <p>According to Clifford Geertz,</p>
      <blockquote>
        "anthropology is perhaps the last of the great nineteenth-century
        conglomerate disciplines still for the most part organizationally
        intact. Long after natural history, moral philosophy, philology, and
        political economy have dissolved into their specialized successors, it
        has remained a diffuse assemblage of ethnology, human biology,
        comparative linguistics, and prehistory, held together mainly by the
        vested interests, sunk costs, and administrative habits of academia, and
        by a romantic image of comprehensive scholarship."
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Sociocultural anthropology has been heavily influenced by structuralist
        and postmodern theories, as well as a shift toward the analysis of
        modern societies. During the 1970s and 1990s, there was an
        epistemological shift away from the positivist traditions that had
        largely informed the discipline.<sup>[33][full citation needed]</sup>
        During this shift, enduring questions about the nature and production of
        knowledge came to occupy a central place in cultural and social
        anthropology. In contrast, archaeology and biological anthropology
        remained largely positivist. Due to this difference in epistemology, the
        four sub-fields of anthropology have lacked cohesion over the last
        several decades.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
      </p>

      <h2>Sociocultural</h2>
      <p>
        Sociocultural anthropology draws together the principal axes of cultural
        anthropology and social anthropology. Cultural anthropology is the
        comparative study of the manifold ways in which people make sense of the
        world around them, while social anthropology is the study of the
        relationships among individuals and groups.<sup>[34]</sup> Cultural
        anthropology is more related to philosophy, literature and the arts (how
        one's culture affects the experience for self and group, contributing to
        a more complete understanding of the people's knowledge, customs, and
        institutions), while social anthropology is more related to sociology
        and history.<sup>[34]</sup> In that, it helps develop an understanding
        of social structures, typically of others and other populations (such as
        minorities, subgroups, dissidents, etc.). There is no hard-and-fast
        distinction between them, and these categories overlap to a considerable
        degree.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inquiry in sociocultural anthropology is guided in part by cultural
        relativism, the attempt to understand other societies in terms of their
        own cultural symbols and values.<sup>[23]</sup> Accepting other cultures
        in their own terms moderates reductionism in cross-cultural
        comparison.<sup>[35]</sup> This project is often accommodated in the
        field of ethnography. Ethnography can refer to both a methodology and
        the product of ethnographic research, i.e. an ethnographic monograph. As
        a methodology, ethnography is based upon long-term fieldwork within a
        community or other research site. Participant observation is one of the
        foundational methods of social and cultural anthropology.<sup>[36]</sup>
        Ethnology involves the systematic comparison of different cultures. The
        process of participant-observation can be especially helpful to
        understanding a culture from an emic (conceptual, vs. etic, or
        technical) point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
        The study of kinship and social organization is a central focus of
        sociocultural anthropology, as kinship is a human universal.
        Sociocultural anthropology also covers economic and political
        organization, law and conflict resolution, patterns of consumption and
        exchange, material culture, technology, infrastructure, gender
        relations, ethnicity, childrearing and socialization, religion, myth,
        symbols, values, etiquette, worldview, sports, music, nutrition,
        recreation, games, food, festivals, and language (which is also the
        object of study in linguistic anthropology).<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Comparison across cultures is a key element of method in sociocultural
        anthropology, including the industrialized (and de-industrialized) West.
        The Standard Cross-Cultural Sample (SCCS) includes 186 such
        cultures.<sup>[37]</sup>
      </p>

      <h2>Biological</h2>
      <p>
        Biological anthropology and physical anthropology are synonymous terms
        to describe anthropological research focused on the study of humans and
        non-human primates in their biological, evolutionary, and demographic
        dimensions. It examines the biological and social factors that have
        affected the evolution of humans and other primates, and that generate,
        maintain or change contemporary genetic and physiological variation.<sup
          >[38]</sup
        >
      </p>

      <h2>Archaeological</h2>
      <p>
        Archaeology is the study of the human past through its material remains.
        Artifacts, faunal remains, and human altered landscapes are evidence of
        the cultural and material lives of past societies. Archaeologists
        examine material remains in order to deduce patterns of past human
        behavior and cultural practices. Ethnoarchaeology is a type of
        archaeology that studies the practices and material remains of living
        human groups in order to gain a better understanding of the evidence
        left behind by past human groups, who are presumed to have lived in
        similar ways.<sup>[39]</sup>
      </p>
      <h2>Linguistic</h2>
      <p>
        Linguistic anthropology (not to be confused with anthropological
        linguistics) seeks to understand the processes of human communications,
        verbal and non-verbal, variation in language across time and space, the
        social uses of language, and the relationship between language and
        culture.<sup>[40]</sup> It is the branch of anthropology that brings
        linguistic methods to bear on anthropological problems, linking the
        analysis of linguistic forms and processes to the interpretation of
        sociocultural processes. Linguistic anthropologists often draw on
        related fields including sociolinguistics, pragmatics, cognitive
        linguistics, semiotics, discourse analysis, and narrative analysis.<sup
          >[41]</sup
        >
      </p>
      <h2>Ethnography</h2>
      <p>
        LiEthnography is a method of analysing social or cultural interaction.
        It often involves participant observation though an ethnographer may
        also draw from texts written by participants of in social interactions.
        Ethnography views first-hand experience and social context as
        important.<sup>[42]</sup>
      </p>

      <p>
        Tim Ingold distinguishes ethnography from anthropology arguing that
        anthropology tries to construct general theories of human experience,
        applicable in general and novel settings, while ethnography concerns
        itself with fidelity. He argues that the anthropologist must make his
        writing consistent with their understanding of literature and other
        theory, but notes that ethnography may be of use to the anthropologists
        and the fields inform one another.<sup>[43]</sup>
      </p>

      <h2>Key topics by field: sociocultural</h2>
      <h3>Art, media, music, dance and film</h3>
      <hr />
      <h3>Art</h3>
      <p>
        One of the central problems in the anthropology of art concerns the
        universality of 'art' as a cultural phenomenon. Several anthropologists
        have noted that the Western categories of 'painting', 'sculpture', or
        'literature', conceived as independent artistic activities, do not
        exist, or exist in a significantly different form, in most non-Western
        contexts.<sup>[44]</sup> To surmount this difficulty, anthropologists of
        art have focused on formal features in objects which, without
        exclusively being 'artistic', have certain evident 'aesthetic'
        qualities. Boas' Primitive Art, Claude Lévi-Strauss' The Way of the
        Masks (1982) or Geertz's 'Art as Cultural System' (1983) are some
        examples in this trend to transform the anthropology of 'art' into an
        anthropology of culturally specific 'aesthetics'.<sup
          >[citation needed]</sup
        >
      </p>
      <h3>Media</h3>
      <p>
        Media anthropology (also known as the anthropology of media or mass
        media) emphasizes ethnographic studies as a means of understanding
        producers, audiences, and other cultural and social aspects of mass
        media. The types of ethnographic contexts explored range from contexts
        of media production (e.g., ethnographies of newsrooms in newspapers,
        journalists in the field, film production) to contexts of media
        reception, following audiences in their everyday responses to media.
        Other types include cyber anthropology, a relatively new area of
        internet research, as well as ethnographies of other areas of research
        which happen to involve media, such as development work, social
        movements, or health education. This is in addition to many classic
        ethnographic contexts, where media such as radio, the press, new media,
        and television have started to make their presences felt since the early
        1990s.<sup>[45]</sup>
      </p>
      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>
        Ethnomusicology is an academic field encompassing various approaches to
        the study of music (broadly defined), that emphasize its cultural,
        social, material, cognitive, biological, and other dimensions or
        contexts instead of or in addition to its isolated sound component or
        any particular repertoire.

        Ethnomusicology can be used in a wide variety of fields, such as
        teaching, politics, cultural anthropology etc. While the origins of
        ethnomusicology date back to the 18th and 19th centuries, it was
        formally termed "ethnomusicology" by Dutch scholar Jaap Kunst around
        1950. Later, the influence of study in this area spawned the creation of
        the periodical Ethnomusicology and the Society of Ethnomusicology.<sup

      <h3>Visual</h3>
      <p>
        Visual anthropology is concerned, in part, with the study and production
        of ethnographic photography, film and, since the mid-1990s, new media.
        While the term is sometimes used interchangeably with ethnographic film,
        visual anthropology also encompasses the anthropological study of visual
        representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and
        the production and reception of mass media. Visual representations from
        all cultures, such as sandpaintings, tattoos, sculptures and reliefs,
        cave paintings, scrimshaw, jewelry, hieroglyphs, paintings, and
        photographs are included in the focus of visual anthropology.<sup

      <h3>Economic, political economic, applied and development</h3>
      <hr />
      <h3>Economic</h3>
      <p>
        Economic anthropology attempts to explain human economic behavior in its
        widest historic, geographic and cultural scope. It has a complex
        relationship with the discipline of economics, of which it is highly
        critical. Its origins as a sub-field of anthropology begin with the
        Polish-British founder of anthropology, Bronisław Malinowski, and his
        French compatriot, Marcel Mauss, on the nature of gift-giving exchange
        (or reciprocity) as an alternative to market exchange. Economic
        Anthropology remains, for the most part, focused upon exchange. The
        school of thought derived from Marx and known as Political Economy
        focuses on production, in contrast.<sup>[47]</sup> Economic
        anthropologists have abandoned the primitivist niche they were relegated
        to by economists, and have now turned to examine corporations, banks,
        and the global financial system from an anthropological perspective.<sup

      <h3>Political economy</h3>
      <p>
        Political economy in anthropology is the application of the theories and
        methods of historical materialism to the traditional concerns of
        anthropology, including, but not limited to, non-capitalist societies.
        Political economy introduced questions of history and colonialism to
        ahistorical anthropological theories of social structure and culture.
        Three main areas of interest rapidly developed. The first of these areas
        was concerned with the "pre-capitalist" societies that were subject to
        evolutionary "tribal" stereotypes. Sahlin's work on hunter-gatherers as
        the "original affluent society" did much to dissipate that image. The
        second area was concerned with the vast majority of the world's
        population at the time, the peasantry, many of whom were involved in
        complex revolutionary wars such as in Vietnam. The third area was on
        colonialism, imperialism, and the creation of the capitalist
        world-system.<sup>[49]</sup> More recently, these political economists
        have more directly addressed issues of industrial (and post-industrial)
        capitalism around the world.

      <h3>Medical, nutritional, psychological, cognitive and transpersonal</h3>
      <hr />
      <h3>Medical</h3>
      <p>
        Medical anthropology is an interdisciplinary field which studies "human
        health and disease, health care systems, and biocultural
        adaptation".[56] It is believed that William Caudell was the first to
        discover the field of medical anthropology. Currently, research in
        medical anthropology is one of the main growth areas in the field of
        anthropology as a whole. It focuses on the following six basic
        fields:<sup>[57]</sup>
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <ol>
          <li>
            the development of systems of medical knowledge and medical care
          </li>
          <li>the patient-physician relationship</li>
          <li>
            the integration of alternative medical systems in culturally diverse
            environments
          </li>
          <li>
            the interaction of social, environmental and biological factors
            which influence health and illness both in the individual and the
            community as a whole
          </li>
          <li>
            the critical analysis of interaction between psychiatric services
            and migrant populations ("critical ethnopsychiatry": Beneduce 2004,
            2007)
          </li>
          <li>
            the impact of biomedicine and biomedical technologies in non-Western
            settings
          </li>
        </ol>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        Other subjects that have become central to medical anthropology
        worldwide are violence and social suffering (Farmer, 1999, 2003;
        Beneduce, 2010) as well as other issues that involve physical and
        psychological harm and suffering that are not a result of illness. On
        the other hand, there are fields that intersect with medical
        anthropology in terms of research methodology and theoretical
        production, such as cultural psychiatry and transcultural psychiatry or
        ethnopsychiatry.
      </p>
      <h3>Nutritional</h3>
      <p>
        Nutritional anthropology is a synthetic concept that deals with the
        interplay between economic systems, nutritional status and food
        security, and how changes in the former affect the latter. If economic
        and environmental changes in a community affect access to food, food
        security, and dietary health, then this interplay between culture and
        biology is in turn connected to broader historical and economic trends
        associated with globalization. Nutritional status affects overall health
        status, work performance potential, and the overall potential for
        economic development (either in terms of human development or
        traditional western models) for any given group of people.
      </p>
      <h2>Post-World War II developments</h2>
      <p>
        Before WWII British 'social anthropology' and American 'cultural
        anthropology' were still distinct traditions. After the war, enough
        British and American anthropologists borrowed ideas and methodological
        approaches from one another that some began to speak of them
        collectively as 'sociocultural' anthropology.
      </p>
      <h3>Basic trends</h3>
      <p>
        There are several characteristics that tend to unite anthropological
        work. One of the central characteristics is that anthropology tends to
        provide a comparatively more holistic account of phenomena and tends to
        be highly empirical.[22] The quest for holism leads most anthropologists
        to study a particular place, problem or phenomenon in detail, using a
        variety of methods, over a more extensive period than normal in many
        parts of academia.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 1990s and 2000s, calls for clarification of what constitutes a
        culture, of how an observer knows where his or her own culture ends and
        another begins, and other crucial topics in writing anthropology were
        heard. These dynamic relationships, between what can be observed on the
        ground, as opposed to what can be observed by compiling many local
        observations remain fundamental in any kind of anthropology, whether
        cultural, biological, linguistic or archaeological.<sup>[112][113]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Biological anthropologists are interested in both human variation<sup
          >[114][115]</sup
        >
        and in the possibility of human universals (behaviors, ideas or concepts
        shared by virtually all human cultures).<sup>[116][117]</sup> They use
        many different methods of study, but modern population genetics,
        participant observation and other techniques often take anthropologists
        "into the field," which means traveling to a community in its own
        setting, to do something called "fieldwork." On the biological or
        physical side, human measurements, genetic samples, nutritional data may
        be gathered and published as articles or monographs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with dividing up their project by theoretical emphasis,
        anthropologists typically divide the world up into relevant time periods
        and geographic regions. Human time on Earth is divided up into relevant
        cultural traditions based on material, such as the Paleolithic and the
        Neolithic, of particular use in archaeology.[citation needed] Further
        cultural subdivisions according to tool types, such as Olduwan or
        Mousterian or Levalloisian help archaeologists and other anthropologists
        in understanding major trends in the human past.[citation needed]
        Anthropologists and geographers share approaches to culture regions as
        well, since mapping cultures is central to both sciences. By making
        comparisons across cultural traditions (time-based) and cultural regions
        (space-based), anthropologists have developed various kinds of
        comparative method, a central part of their science.
